Most space exploration is done by robots. Even the space exploration by humans is only experienced by a very small number of people. VR 360 pictures and video can be used to bring space exploration to a larger number of people.

1) Mars Exploration
A reconstruction of Mars' surface
Tour from holographic Buzz Aldrin
2x More accurate at determining specific distances
3x more accurate at determining specific angles
Geologists, many from outside field, felt tool was more accurate
realized they could run up a hill to get spatial awareness

2) Project Sidekick
Experts can guide astronauts on ISS through complicated procedures by watching astronauts' actions and overly guidance, diagrams, and other info
Practiced appendicitis diagnosing and testing on underwater facility and vomet comet
Reduced time from 4 hours to 1 hour
Played space invaders

3) Protospace
Engineers can explore detailed models of spacecraft and machinery as they're designed
Allow for a group of mechanical engineers ot collaboratively visualize a design in true scale
Can see how parts fit together better than 2d modelling
Can practice tricky installation

Designed Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite which will be used to observe climate change's effect on the oceans
Designed Mars 2020 Rover which will collect Martian surface samples and bring them back to Earth
Designed large orbiter to circle Europa

4) Data gathered by orbiters can be used to explore virtually and guide rovers or astronauts
Everyone could help explore together not just JPL and NASA.

5) keep astronauts sane
